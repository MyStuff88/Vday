            <p>i have feelings of pure regret. unfiltered hatred.</p>
            <p>i thought i let things get in the way of my life, so i pushed people out. i pushed you out. i hated myself so much i projected on anyone who was willing to love me.</p>
            <p>i let that hate get to you. even after we dated. i got too angry and dissapointed at things. i put too much pressure and judgement on you for mistakes you regret. i've always been so blinded by hatred and judgement. resentment.</p>
            <p>it took a lot of effort from your end to convince me there was a whole other spectrum of colors, the world wasn't just black and white.</p>

            <h1>It was a long road getting here</h1>
            <p>We had some bad laps but the race is far from over. Looking at my grades its obvious i dont know much. What i do know is that we've always been the people to talk through things. We've been through too much together to leave each other.</p>
            <p>Thank you for being a part of my life for so long. Thank you for trusting me with your thoughts and emotions. Thank you for opening up to me. Thank you for the hugs and kisses. Thank you for being you. You are perfect.</p>
